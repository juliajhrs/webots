# Webots
Developed a simulation involving 2-wheeled Scout Robots and a Leader Robot within Webots environments, implemented in C++. The robots are tasked with identifying, exploring, and reporting on various Objects of Interest. 

Key contributions include:
1. Object-Oriented Programming: Utilized C++ to create a robust simulation framework. Implemented an abstract base class, BaseRobot, to encapsulate common functionalities and interfaces for all robot types.
2. Inheritance: The LeaderRobot and ScoutRobot classes inherit from BaseRobot, allowing for code reuse and a clear hierarchy.
3. Polymorphism: Enabled dynamic method resolution, allowing different robot types to override and implement specific behaviors while maintaining a unified interface.
4. Encapsulation: Applied encapsulation to manage the internal state and behavior of each robot, ensuring that implementation details are hidden and protected from outside interference.
